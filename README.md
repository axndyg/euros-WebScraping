To be filled in

A lot ot the code is redunant, or at least could of been fashioned more efficiently. I am keeping the code in its original form as I work on code needed to address how prior code produced data that didn't come out as we needed it later on. The purpose of keeping old code and writing new code to ammend it is to show progress of my understanding with webscraping and formatting it in a desired manner. As well, the practice of ammending the old code is beneficial to continue to learn how to manipualte data through python and it's packages
