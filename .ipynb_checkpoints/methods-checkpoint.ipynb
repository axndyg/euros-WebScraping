    "A *Decision Tree* is a binary tree that splits supplied data between **decision nodes**  and **leaf nodes** \n",
    "\n",
    "> Decision Node: A node with a prerequisite that will split data into mixed or pure data <br>\n",
    "> -  A Decision Node leading to mixed data will lead to more decisions nodes\n",

    "> Leaf Node: A node containing **pure** parsed data as a result of a decision node <br>\n",

    "\n",
    "The conditionals in a decision node are random and attempt to gain the optimal split (best series of conditionals that lead to pure data the fastest) by determining the minimum **entropy**\n",
    "\n",
    "> entropy: measure of data randomness, the higher the entropy, the higher disorder and hence higher unpredictability <br>\n",

    "#### A Random Forest Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "A Random Forest is a collection of Multiple decision trees, less responsive to minor changes in the dataset that it trains off of. \n",
    "\n",
    "A random selection of the data will be sparsed into **Bootstrapped Data** which is a rearrangement and random sampled with replacement (meaning rows can occur again) for new decision trees and isolated new predcitors \n",

    "> <img src=\"./graphics/rf_tree.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice, that fed off data, it passes the row into each decision tree and see what the decision tree decides. There is then a \"vote\" held with the majority outcome selected "
